# Paloma et al. 2019 - Observational Study of the Thermodynamics and Morphological Characteristics of a Midlatitude Continential Cold Pool Event

## Introduction

- Cold pools from first-gen storms
    - Important for initiation, intensity, and lifecycle of secondary storms

- Cold pool importance
    - Has substantial impact on MCSs (able to bring new life to them)
        - Also influences their organization and structure
    - Environmental air moving over the edge of the cold pool can trigger new convection
    - Can lead to flash flooding when cold pool and environmental flow are in balance with one another
    - Wind gusts near the leading edge of cold pools can impact the aviation industry
    - Cold pools impact land-atmosphere interactions which can change PBL characteristics
        - Moisture, heat, momentum, etc. 
    - Results in a stable layer near surface, which inhibits convection

- Cold pools are difficult to model
    - Uncertainty about the microphysical processes
        - Could impact the horizontal extent, depth, or strength

- Often use surface observations
    - OK Mesonet used in the past
        - Temperature, Pressure, Wind Speed, Wind Direction
 
- Use soundings to estimate cold pool depth
    - Need targeted observations (Field Campaigns!)
        - Northern Illinois Meteorological Research on Downburst (NIMROD) (Wakimoto 1982)
        - Thunderstorm Project (Byers and Braham 1949)
        - NSSL Experiments (Sanders and Emanuel 1977, Ogura and Chen 1977, Ogura and Chen 1980, Park and Sikdar 1982)
        - Bow Echo and Mesoscale Convective Vortex Experiment (BAMEX) (Byran et al. 2005, Ahijevych et al. 2006)
        - Second Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2) (Bryan and Parker 2010)
        - Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) (Geerts et al. 2017, Hitchcock et al. 2019)

- In this study, used observations from Midlatitude Continential Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) (Jensen et al. 2016)
    - When?
     - June 2011
    - Observations included 
        - Atmospheric Radiation Measurment
            - Weather stations, radars, soundings
        - OK Mesonet
            - Weather stations
        - NEXRAD Doppler Radars
            - Reflectivity, dual pol products

- Main Goal
    - Use observations to quantify evolution of cold pool characterisitcs over a time period of a few hours
    - Utilize targeted observations in addition to NEXRAD/OK Mesonet data
        - Use for detection and analysis of intensity, height, and speed of the cold pool
    - Create a new methodology for identifying cold pools from radar
        - Proof of concept using NEXRAD observations
